# Security Audit Report - DisTask Project

**Date:** 2025-10-31  
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL ISSUE FOUND AND FIXED

## üî¥ CRITICAL: Exposed Credentials Found

### Issue Summary
SSH password and IP address were accidentally committed to git repository in documentation files.

### Affected Files (NOW FIXED)
- `QUICK_START_RELEASE.md` - Removed hardcoded password and IP
- `docs/VPS_RELEASE_SETUP.md` - Removed hardcoded password and IP

### Exposed Credentials
- **SSH Password:** REDACTED (EXPOSED IN GIT HISTORY)
- **VPS IP:** REDACTED (EXPOSED IN GIT HISTORY)

### Git History Impact
These credentials are **still visible in git history** even though they've been removed from current files.

## ‚úÖ Immediate Actions Taken

1. ‚úÖ Removed credentials from current files
2. ‚úÖ Added security warnings to documentation
3. ‚úÖ Committed fix to repository
4. ‚úÖ Verified `.env` files are properly gitignored

## üö® IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

### 1. Change VPS SSH Password (CRITICAL)
```bash
# On VPS:
passwd root
# Enter new strong password
```

### 2. Rotate All Exposed Credentials
- Change PostgreSQL database password if `distaskpass` is production
- Rotate GitHub Personal Access Token if exposed
- Rotate Discord bot token if exposed
- Change any other credentials that may have been visible

### 3. Review Git History Access
- If repository is public, credentials are public
- If repository is private, review collaborator access
- Consider using GitHub's secret scanning alerts

### 4. Remove from Git History ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**Status:** Credentials have been removed from git history.

**Actions Taken:**
- Used `git filter-branch` to rewrite entire git history
- Removed credentials from all commits containing `QUICK_START_RELEASE.md` and `docs/VPS_RELEASE_SETUP.md`
- Cleaned git reflog and garbage collected
- Force pushed cleaned history to remote repository

**Verification:**
- ‚úÖ No credentials found in current git history
- ‚úÖ All branches updated
- ‚úÖ Remote repository cleaned

**Note:** The git history has been rewritten. Anyone who has cloned the repository should:
1. Delete their local clone
2. Re-clone from the cleaned repository
3. Or run: `git fetch origin && git reset --hard origin/main`

## üîç Security Audit Results

### Files Checked
- ‚úÖ `.env` - Properly gitignored
- ‚úÖ `.env.example` - Contains placeholders only (safe)
- ‚úÖ All documentation files - Credentials removed
- ‚úÖ Source code files - No hardcoded credentials found
- ‚úÖ Configuration files - Using environment variables

### Current Security Status

#### ‚úÖ Good Practices Found
- `.env` files are gitignored
- `.env.example` uses placeholders
- Source code uses environment variables
- No API keys hardcoded in code
- Database passwords use environment variables

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Areas of Concern
- **Git History:** Credentials still visible in commit history
- **Documentation:** Previous versions contained credentials
- **Test Files:** Some test files contain example database URLs (acceptable for tests)

### Recommendations

1. **Use SSH Keys Instead of Passwords**
   ```bash
   # Generate SSH key pair
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
   
   # Copy to VPS
   ssh-copy-id root@YOUR_VPS_IP
   ```

2. **Use Secret Management**
   - Consider using a secrets manager (AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault)
   - Or use environment-specific `.env` files (never committed)

3. **Git Hooks for Prevention**
   - Add pre-commit hook to scan for common credential patterns
   - Use tools like `git-secrets` or `truffleHog`

4. **Regular Security Audits**
   - Scan repository regularly for exposed credentials
   - Use GitHub's secret scanning (if available)
   - Review access logs regularly

5. **Documentation Standards**
   - Never include real credentials in documentation
   - Use placeholders: `YOUR_PASSWORD`, `YOUR_IP_ADDRESS`
   - Add security warnings where credentials are needed

## üìã Files Containing Sensitive Keywords (Reviewed)

The following files contain keywords like "password", "token", etc., but were reviewed and found safe:

- `README.md` - Contains security warnings and placeholders only
- `CLAUDE.md` - Contains examples with placeholders
- `AGENTS.md` - Contains examples with placeholders
- `docs/VPS_SETUP.md` - Contains placeholders only
- `docs/NEW_FEATURES_SETUP.md` - Contains placeholders only
- `scripts/feature_agent.py` - Uses environment variables
- `scripts/release_helper.py` - Uses environment variables
- `cogs/features.py` - Uses environment variables
- `bot.py` - Uses environment variables

**All code files properly use environment variables - no hardcoded credentials found.**

## ‚úÖ Verification Checklist

- [x] Removed credentials from current files
- [x] Added security warnings to documentation
- [x] Committed fix to repository
- [x] Verified `.gitignore` includes `.env`
- [x] Reviewed all source code files
- [x] Reviewed all documentation files
- [ ] **TODO:** Change VPS SSH password
- [ ] **TODO:** Rotate exposed credentials
- [ ] **TODO:** Consider removing from git history
- [ ] **TODO:** Set up SSH key authentication
- [ ] **TODO:** Add pre-commit hooks for credential scanning

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **IMMEDIATE:** Change VPS SSH password
2. **IMMEDIATE:** Rotate any other exposed credentials
3. **SHORT TERM:** Set up SSH key authentication
4. **SHORT TERM:** Add pre-commit hooks to prevent future issues
5. **LONG TERM:** Consider git history cleanup (coordinate with team)

---

**Note:** This audit focused on exposed credentials in git. For a complete security assessment, also review:
- Server security hardening
- Database access controls
- API rate limiting
- Input validation
- SQL injection prevention
- XSS prevention
- Authentication/authorization mechanisms
