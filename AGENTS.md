# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- `bot.py` loads env config, configures logging, and registers all cogs; it's the Discord entrypoint.
- `cogs/` contains slash-command groups (`boards.py`, `tasks.py`, `admin.py`, `features.py`); register new cogs in `bot.py`.
- `utils/` centralizes async helpers (PostgreSQL wrapper, embeds, validators, reminders, GitHub exports) for reuse across cogs.
- `scripts/feature_agent.py` runs the feature-request automation (dedupe, scoring, git sync); schedule it in CI or cron as needed.
- `scripts/release_helper.py` provides rapid release flow (score-based selection, validation, versioning, GitHub releases).
- `scripts/validate.py` handles pre-commit validation (linting, tests, schema checks).
- `web/app.py` hosts the FastAPI landing page and `/status` endpoint used by `distask.service`.
- `data/` and `logs/` are runtime outputs (archives/backups, rotating logs); keep them out of commits.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- `python -m venv .venv` followed by `source .venv/bin/activate` prepares an isolated environment.
- `.venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt` installs Discord bot and web dependencies.
- `python bot.py` starts the bot and ensures the configured PostgreSQL schema + default board columns exist.
- `python scripts/feature_agent.py` runs the backlog automation pass (requires DB + git access). The VPS also runs it nightly at 03:30 CST via `distask-feature-agent.timer` (install with `sudo cp distask-feature-agent.* /etc/systemd/system/ && sudo systemctl daemon-reload && sudo systemctl enable --now distask-feature-agent.timer`).
- `uvicorn web.app:app --reload` runs the status site locally on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.
- `tail -f logs/distask.log` streams structured logs for troubleshooting instead of ad-hoc prints.

### Community Voting

- Populate `community_guild_id`, `community_channel_id`, and `community_feature_webhook` in `.env` so `/request-feature` announcements land in the community server.
- The bot posts embeds via webhook, then adds üëç / üëé / üîÅ reactions. Reaction events update the `community_*` counters on each feature request, which the automation uses for scoring.
- If the webhook/channel changes, update `.env` and restart `distask.service` plus `distask-feature-agent.timer`.

### GitHub Credentials

- Keep `github_token` in `.env`; restart services after rotating the PAT.
- Persist the PAT for git pushes with the credential helper so commits survive restarts:

  ```bash
  git config --global credential.helper store
  git credential approve <<'EOF'
  protocol=https
  host=github.com
  username=YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME
  password=YOUR_PAT
  EOF
  chmod 600 ~/.git-credentials
  ```

- When the PAT expires, repeat both the `.env` update and credential helper step with the new token.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- Use 4-space indentation, PEP 8 spacing, and keep imports ordered stdlib ‚Üí third-party ‚Üí local.
- Annotate new functions with type hints; prefer `async def` for Discord handlers and explicit return types.
- Adopt `snake_case` for modules/functions, `PascalCase` for cogs/classes, and uppercase constants such as `ISO_FORMAT`.
- Slash-command names stay lowercase with hyphens; embed titles use concise sentence case.

## Testing Guidelines
- Automated coverage is pending; add tests under `tests/` and run them via `pytest` (with `pytest-asyncio` for coroutines).
- Point `DATABASE_URL` at a throwaway PostgreSQL database (or schema) when validating database helpers; clean up fixtures after each run.
- Record manual checks (e.g., `/create-board`, `/add-task`) in PRs and reference `logs/distask.log` output.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

**PR-First Approach:** Always create a Pull Request before implementing feature requests to get code review. See [Feature Request Workflow Guide](docs/FEATURE_REQUEST_WORKFLOW.md) for complete details.

- Follow existing history: imperative subjects with optional scopes (`feat:`, `web:`), e.g., `feat: tighten reminders`.
- **Create PR first** on branch `feature/<id>-short-slug` before implementing
- **Install git hooks** (`./scripts/setup-git-hooks.sh`) to auto-inject FR markers from branch names
- Reference feature requests in implementation commits and PR titles using `FR-<id>` (for example `FR-123`) so the automation can mark them completed automatically.
- Automation scans both **merged PRs** (title + description) and **commits** for FR markers
- Missing the reference leaves the request `pending`; the automation will revert any manual status edits the next time it exports `feature_requests.md`.
- Keep unrelated changes in separate commits and ship schema updates with the cogs that use them.
- PRs should include a summary, testing notes, linked issue or Discord thread, and visuals for embed/UI tweaks.
- Highlight permission changes or new env vars in the PR title or checklist.

## Security & Configuration Tips
- Copy `.env.example` to `.env`, store secrets outside git, and point systemd units at that file. Populate `github_token`/`repo_owner`/`repo_name` so `/request-feature` exports succeed and the automation can publish updates.
- The feature agent persists a cursor in `data/feature_agent_state.json`; the folder is git-ignored, ensure deployments retain it between runs if you need incremental git scans.
- Run services as a non-root user and restrict access to `data/` and `logs/`.
- PostgreSQL enforces password authentication; when sanity-checking, run `PGPASSWORD=yourpass psql -h localhost -U youruser -d yourdb -c "select now();"` so you don‚Äôt misinterpret `pg_isready` ‚Äúno response‚Äù warnings.
- Update the invite URL in `web/app.py` whenever the `discord_client_id` changes.
- Last updated: $(date) - Verified commit process working correctly.
