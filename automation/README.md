# Feature Automation Outputs

This directory stores artefacts generated by `scripts/feature_agent.py`:

- `feature_queue.json` – machine-readable backlog with ranking, score components, and metadata.
- `feature_queue.md` – human-friendly table using the same ordering.

The automation script recreates these files on each run. They are optional in git history, but committing them after a run provides downstream visibility into upcoming work.
