# Feature Automation Outputs

This directory stores artefacts generated by `scripts/feature_agent.py`:

- `feature_queue.json` – machine-readable backlog with ranking, score components, and metadata.
- `feature_queue.md` – human-friendly table using the same ordering.

Both artefacts now surface community voting signals: net 👍/👎 counts and duplicate reaction totals, plus the computed vote bonus/penalty that feeds the nightly score.

The automation script recreates these files on each run. They are optional in git history, but committing them after a run provides downstream visibility into upcoming work.

On production, the `distask-feature-agent.timer` systemd unit runs the generator nightly at 03:30 CST (08:30 UTC). You can also trigger it manually with `sudo systemctl start distask-feature-agent.service` when you need an immediate refresh.

Git pushes from automation still rely on the git credential helper. Ensure the PAT is stored with `git credential approve` (see README for the snippet) so exports succeed after reboots and when the token is rotated.
