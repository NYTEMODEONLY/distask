| 5 | 85711387883499520 | 1432217453370413118 | Board Checks before deletion | the bot checks for columns if they have tasks in them before deleting, but deleting a whole board works no problem with no confirmation. Needs a confirm / validation step as well. | High | pending | - | - | - | - | - | 2025-10-28 00:57:58 UTC | - |
| 4 | 536648724244332544 | 1432217453370413118 | Separate boards and tasks between channel/server | I’d like to be able to create a board that can be accessible server wide vs within a channel and to be able to change that. also same for tasks | - | pending | - | - | 10 | - | 2025-10-27 23:15:13 UTC | 2025-10-27 21:59:54 UTC | - |
| 3 | 536648724244332544 | 1432217453370413118 | Separate commands by global/local/other | I would like to see which commands are used for just the server I’m in, and which commands would be used for things outside of the server. So when I type “/“ and see a list of all commands available, I want to know which ones will be used in the server that the bot is in (I.e. create task, create board, etc) vs submitting a feature request, which is sent to github I believe. This can potentially be taken one step further to tell me if a command will work within a specific channel or if it will work throughout the  server I.e. if I make a task will it be able to be managed in another channel or is it silo’d to the channel I’m in | - | pending | - | - | 10 | - | 2025-10-27 23:15:13 UTC | 2025-10-27 21:41:28 UTC | - |
