So when I type “/“ and see a list of all commands available, I want to know which ones will be used in the server that the bot is in (I.e. create task, create board, etc) vs submitting a feature request, which is sent to github I believe. This can potentially be taken one step further to tell me if a command will work within a specific channel or if it will work throughout the  server I.e. if I make a task will it be able to be managed in another channel or is it silo’d to the channel I’m in | - | completed | - | - | 10 | 0 | 0 | 0 | - | 2025-10-30 18:07:55 UTC | 2025-10-27 21:41:28 UTC | 2025-10-30 18:07:55 UTC |
